# Predicting Lotto Numbers with AI
This project applies various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict lottery numbers based on historical data. Although lottery outcomes are inherently random, this project explores AI's ability to detect patterns and trends within the data.

## Introduction

This project predicts lotto numbers using machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. 

In addition to prediction, we have included **statistical analysis** to compare historical data and validate the occurrence patterns of winning numbers using Chi-square tests and Poisson probabilities.

## Significance of the Project

This project demonstrates the application of statistical and machine learning techniques in understanding patterns within seemingly random events. 
By combining Chi-square tests, Poisson probabilities, and predictive models, we highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches.

The insights gained from this analysis are not only relevant to lotto predictions but also applicable to various fields, such as financial risk modeling and anomaly detection.

## Descriptive Statistics of Lotto Data

To understand the characteristics of the historical lotto data, we calculated the following descriptive statistics:

- **Mean Frequency**: 158
- **Standard Deviation**: 15.3
- **Mode**: Numbers 3, 7, and 12 (appeared 160 times)

The historical data suggests that lotto numbers are fairly evenly distributed, with no significant biases observed.

## Statistical Analysis

To enhance the predictive analysis, this project includes statistical validation of lotto numbers using the following methods:

### 1. Chi-square Test
We performed a Chi-square test to compare the observed frequencies of lotto numbers in historical data with the 1149th winning numbers.

- **Chi-square Statistic**: 40.19
- **p-value**: 0.6357
- **Interpretation**: The p-value indicates no statistically significant difference between the historical distribution and the new numbers.

### Chi-square Test Interpretation
The p-value of 0.6357 suggests that the observed frequencies of the 1149th lotto numbers do not significantly differ from the historical frequencies. This aligns with the assumption that lotto numbers are generated randomly. 
However, understanding this randomness can help identify whether certain patterns emerge over a large dataset, which could provide insights into the distribution of such events.

### 2. Poisson Probabilities
The probability of each winning number appearing was calculated using the Poisson distribution, based on the mean frequency of historical data.

#### Results:
| Number | Probability |
|--------|-------------|
| 8      | 0.0000000000 |
| 15     | 0.0000000000 |
| 19     | 0.0000000000 |
| 21     | 0.0000000000 |
| 32     | 0.0000000000 |
| 36     | 0.0000000000 |

**Interpretation**:
The extremely low probabilities indicate that the 1149th winning numbers are rare in the context of historical data, which is expected due to the randomness of lotto results.

#### Poisson Probability Insights
The calculated probabilities for the 1149th numbers being near zero indicates their rarity, which is consistent with the random nature of lotto draws. 
By comparing these probabilities with the historical average frequency (Î»=~158), we confirm that such numbers fall well below typical occurrences.

## Machine Learning vs Statistical Analysis

Comparing the predicted numbers from the Random Forest model with the statistical insights, we find that frequently predicted numbers align with the higher frequencies observed in historical data. 
However, low Poisson probabilities highlight that randomness still plays a dominant role in lotto outcomes.

This comparison demonstrates how machine learning can identify patterns, while statistical tests validate the randomness of these events.
